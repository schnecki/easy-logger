# Easy Logging for Haskell

Easy-logger can be used to easily create logs, without handling any Monad. Just log as you go. The
package provides logging for code that lives in the `IO` Monad, implements `MonadIO m`, as well as
for pure code.

## Usage

Initialise the logger for your package and start logging:

    {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell     #-}
    import           EasyLogger
    import qualified Data.Text  as T

    main :: IO ()
    main = do
      $(initLogger) (LogFile "package.log")
      $(logInfo) ("Starting App" :: T.Text)
      ...
      # At the end of your program, flush the buffers:
      finalizeAllLoggers

The log output looks like this:

    $ cat package.log
    [INFO #22-Oct-2021 12:27:23] Starting App                           @(main:Main


If you use libraries, **including your own package library**, to log from a file outside of
`Main.hs` you need to make the library package name available and enable the logging specifically. For this create following file:

    {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}
    module MyPackage.Logging
        ( enableMyPackageLogging
        , disableMyPackageLogging
        ) where

    import           EasyLogger

    enableMyPackageLogging :: LogDestination -> IO ()
    enableMyPackageLogging = $(initLogger)

    disableMyPackageLogging :: IO ()
    disableMyPackageLogging = $(finalizeLogger)

and then enable it:

    {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell     #-}
    import           EasyLogger
    import           MyPackage.Logging
    import qualified Data.Text  as T

    main :: IO ()
    main = do
      $(initLogger) (LogFile "package.log")
      enableMyPackageLogging (LogFile "package.log")
      ...
      # At the end of your program, flush the buffers:
      finalizeAllLoggers


You can also include the logs of all the libraries that you use and which use the `easy-logger`
package for logging:

    {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell     #-}
    import           EasyLogger
    import qualified Data.Text                          as T

    main :: IO ()
    main = do
      $(initLoggerAllPackages) (LogFile "package.log") True
      $(logInfo) ("Starting App" :: T.Text)
      ...
      # At the end of your program, flush the buffers:
      finalizeAllLoggers

You want to log in pure code without wrapping anything in a Monad? Here you go:

    fromEither :: Either String Int -> Int
    fromEither (Right v)  = v
    fromEither (Left str) = $(pureLogPrintError) ("Parse error: " <> T.pack str) defaultValue
    defaultValue = 0

Under the hood `pureLogPrintError` uses `unsafePerformIO` to log. The return value, i.e.
`defaultValue` in the example, ensures that the log is actually executed when the error occurs.

## Log Levels and Destinations

The available log levels are:

    -- | Log Level. Levels are sorted. `All` < `Debug` < `Info` < `Warning` < `Error`.
    --   None disables all logging. Default: All
    data LogLevel
      = LogNone
      | LogAll
      | LogDebug
      | LogInfo
      | LogWarning
      | LogError
      deriving (Show, Read, Bounded, Enum, Eq, Ord)

The logger can be used to log to `stderr`, `stdout` or a file:

    -- | Logging destination. See also `setLoggingDestination`.
    data LogDestination
      = LogStdErr
      | LogStdOut
      | LogFile FilePath


## Library

If you are exposing a library (including your own library), let your user turn on/off the logging
for your library. The Template-Haskell code ensures that your package name is provided to the
logger, and thus logging for this module only is turned on/off.


    {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}
    module My.Great.Package.Logging
        ( enableMyGreatPackageLogging
        , disableMyGreatPackageLogging
        ) where

    import           EasyLogger

    enableMyGreatPackageLogging :: LogDestination -> IO ()
    enableMyGreatPackageLogging = $(initLogger)

    disableMyGreatPackageLogging :: IO ()
    disableMyGreatPackageLogging = $(finalizeLogger)
